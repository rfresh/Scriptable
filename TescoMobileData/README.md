# Tesco Mobile Data

## About

This widget displays mobile data usage and remaining allowance on the home screen of iOS or iPadOS devices. It is displayed via the [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app) app. The widget obtains data from [tescomobile.com APIs](https://tescomobile.com).

## How to use

To use this widget, make a new script inside Scriptable and paste in the contents of `TescoMobileData.js`. 

You can run the script from within the app, or add a new **small** widget on your home screen, set it to Scriptable, and choose the script by tapping and holding on the widget, choosing Edit Widget, and choosing the script by tapping on the Script field. 

You will require an API key to obtain data from tescomobile.com. If you don't have one, you'll need to follow the instructions below.

## Obtaining an API_KEY and AUTH_TOKEN

The Tesco Mobile API is not open to the public, so you'll need to obtain the secrets by installing your own certificate on your phone and recording them.
